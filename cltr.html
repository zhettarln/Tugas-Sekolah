              <h1>Hinduism</h1>

              <p>Foreigners come and go, but Bali still manages to preserve its original traditions for thousands of years. Balinese people follow the unique form of Hinduism - Agama Hindu Dharma. 
              Balinese Hinduists believe in a power of nature, they believe that each element is influenced by spirits. Spirits and ancestors are very highly appreciated, that’s why you see people making the rituals and offerings every day. 
              Hinduism in Bali was influenced by animism, Buddhism and also by local traditions (adat), therefore, comparing to the Indian form of Hinduism, it formed in a different direction and has many different elements.
              Even though it might be many times confusing, Balinese Hindus believe in only one Supreme God called‘Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa’ and all the other gods are manifestation of this Supreme Being. 
              Balinese Hinduism has five pillars of faith: belief in one Supreme God (brahma), belief in the soul as the universal principle of life and consciousness (atma), belief in the process of reincarnation (samsara) belief in the fruition of one's deeds (karma phala) and belief in ultimate release, unity with God (moksa).

              <h1>Reincarnation and Karma</h1>
              <p>The reincarnation in Bali is usually within the family, so every newborn baby is believed to have one of the ancestors’ soul. 
              Balinese believe in karma, which is understood as a result of physical and spiritual activity of each individual. What you give is what you get. 
              You bring your karma from your past life into the present life and will take karma from this life to your future one - your next reincarnation. 
              After death, soul passes to another body, but always seeking to free itself from incarnation so that it can attain enlightenment – the unity with the God. 
              When person dies, but its soul has not yet achieved this state, it continues with the incarnations.

              <h1>Ceremonies</h1>
              <p>Every important event in human life is always followed by particular ceremony, for example there are Balinese ceremonies for birth, puberty, maturity, marriage or death, 
              then there are ceremonies on important holidays in Balinese calendar as Nyepi (day of silence), Galungan and Kuningan or ceremonies connected with natural phenomena (like full moon or no moon). 
              With these ceremonies and daily rituals, people are getting closer to the gods, ancestors, families and community.</p>

              <h1>Traditions</h1>
              <p>Tourists find Balinese traditions and beliefs very interesting, because of their uniqueness. When you visit Bali for the first time, it's a must to see at least one of the important temples. 
                If you come during big ceremony, you'll witness the crowd of people dressed in white or colorful traditional clothes, bringing plenty offerings made mostly of food, fruit and flowers. 
                After they place the offerings, they sit together and follow the praying ritual led by a priest.
